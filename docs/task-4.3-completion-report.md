let finalFare = baseFare;
for (const multiplier of applicableMultipliers) {
  finalFare *= multiplier.multiplier_value;
}
```

### Constraint Application
```javascript
// Apply minimum fare
if (finalFare < vehicleType.minimum_fare) {
  finalFare = vehicleType.minimum_fare;
}

// Apply maximum fare
if (vehicleType.maximum_fare && finalFare > vehicleType.maximum_fare) {
  finalFare = vehicleType.maximum_fare;
}
```
