  event_type ENUM('seasonal', 'holiday', 'special_event', 'demand_surge') NOT NULL,
  start_date TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  end_date TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  pricing_multiplier DECIMAL(5,2) NOT NULL,
  affected_vehicle_types JSON,
  affected_areas JSON,
  description TEXT,
  is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
